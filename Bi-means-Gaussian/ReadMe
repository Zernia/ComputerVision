Algorithm steps: 

step 0: inFile  args[0]
        outFile1  args[1]
	    outFile2  args[2]
	    outFile3  args[3]
	   	   
step 1: numRows, numCols, minVal, maxVal  read from inFile
step	2: offSet  (int) (maxVal - minVal) / 10  
   thrVal offSet

step	3: histAry  dynamically allocate and initialized to zero
 	  GaussAry  dynamically allocate and initialized to zero
 	 histGraph  dynamically allocate and initialized to zero
  GaussGraph  dynamically allocate and initialized to zero
  gapGraph  dynamically allocate and initialized to zero

step	4: loadHist (histAry, inFile) 
step	5: plotHistGraph (histGraph)	  
		prettyPrint (histGraph, outFile1) // with caption	

step 6: bestThrVal  biMeanGauss (thrVal) 
	output bestThrVal to outFile1 // with caption 

step 7: bestThrPlot (bestThrVal) // plotting the result of Gaussian curves  
	prettyPrint(GaussGraph, outFile1)  // with caption

step 8: prettyPrint(gapGraph, outFile1) // with caption
step 9: close all files
