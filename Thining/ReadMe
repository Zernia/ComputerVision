step 0: inFile<-open from argv
        outFile1, outFile2<-open from argv
step 1:numRows, numCols, minVal, maxVal<-read from inFile
       outFile1<-output numRows, numCols, minVal, maxVal to outFile1 
       dynamically allocate firstAry of size numRows + 2 by numCols + 2.
       dynamically allocate secondAry of size numRows + 2 by numCols + 2.
step 2:zeroFrame(firstAry)
       zeroFrame(secondAry)
step 3:loadImage (inFile, firstAry)
step 4:prettyPrint (firstAry, outFile2) // This print is before thinning 
step 5:changeFlag<-0
step 6:doThinning (firstAry, secondAry, changeFlag)
Step 7:prettyPrint (firstAry, outFile2)
Step 8:repeat step 5 to step 7 while changeFlag > 0
step 9:outFile1<-output firstAry from [1][1] *without* extra rows and cols
step 10: close all files
